This is my first C# project. It's based on the guided project Microsoft Learn's C# learning path program.

It's largely the same, but I try to use a few smarter pieces of logic where I can. Main reason for making this a repo is to have a place to review C# concepts as I need to (IE, how a do-while loop works etc.)
